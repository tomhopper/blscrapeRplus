Title: Provides an interface to blscrapeR::bls_api() that downloads all data between two years
Version: 1.1.2
Author: Thomas Hopper
Maintainer: Thomas Hopper <tomhopper@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a wrapper for blscrapeR::bls_api() to simplify downloading and saving
  data series. Where bls_api() will return only a range of years supported by a single call to
  the BLS' API (Up to 20 years for calls with a registered API key, and 10 years without one), 
  get_bls_data() and load_bls_data() will return all data between two years, or all
  available data, in a single data frame. load_bls_data() also will save the data to an R serialized
  data file using saveRDS(). If the file already exists, load_bls_data() will skip downloading data
  from the BLS (saving time) and simply load the data from the specified file.
